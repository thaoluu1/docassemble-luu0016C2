# Text to display explaining that a written contract is not necessary
# when suing for breach of contract.
template: MJFwritten_contract_template
content: |
  **You do not need to write your contract down to prove you have a contract.**
  
  Although you may have never signed anything, this doesn't necessarily mean there is no contract. A contract may exist without a written document if you and someone else:
  
   - promised to do some work; and,
   - promised to pay for that work.
   
  A written contract is evidence of what was promised, but is not required to prove the promises ever existed.

  Based on your responses, 
  you **may be able to sue** for breach of contract.
  
  Reminder that this application should not be taken as genuine legal advice. You should seek independent legal advice.
  
  Some evidence you may wish to collect include:
  
  - text messages
  - phone call logs
  - diary entries.

  % if MJFwritten_contract:
  Be sure to include evidence of your written contract.
  % else:

# What to display it the app determines a contract doesn't exist.  This
# template is quite a bit more complex than the exists template as 
# we need to explain why the user can't sue.  The reasons why will
# depend on the user's responses to any of the contract law questions
# that we asked.
template: MJFnot_contract_exists_template

  Based on your responses, you **may not be able to sue** for 
  breach of contract.
  You should still seek legal advice for a formal legal opinion.
  Based on your responses:
  
  % if MJFcertainty != 'MJFagree_exact':
  1. You and the other person did not agree to do this work, or all of this work,
    or there was other work done that was not agreed to.
  % endif
  % if not MJFconsideration:
  2. You never reached a firm agreement on how much to pay for the work done.
  % endif
  % if not MJFcapacity:
  3. The other person was under 18.  It is possible in some circumstances to enter into a contract with people under 18.  
  
  You should seek legal advice about whether your situation meets these circumstances.
  % endif
  In order for there to be a contract, you need to prove these things:
  1. That you and the other person agreed to the work to be done.
  2. That you and the other person agreed to how much you would pay for the work.
  3. That you and the other person are able to enter into a contract.  Usually this means you both should be over 18 years old.  You need to seek legal advice if one or both of you is under 18.
